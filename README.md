## Features

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit:** We've integrated Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, ensuring a smooth user experience as you navigate and interact with your family tree.

- **Search Feature:** Easily search for family members using the intuitive search functionality. Find and access specific family members with ease.

- **Data Persistence:** All family tree data created or modified within the app is automatically saved to a JSON file. This ensures that your family tree remains intact even after you close the application.

- **Import and Export:** Seamlessly import and export your family tree data using the "Import JSON File" and "Export JSON File" buttons. Share your family tree with others or back it up for safekeeping.

- **Deployment:** You can deploy this app on platforms like Netlify or any other portal of your choice. Share your family registry app with family members and collaborators for a truly collaborative experience.
